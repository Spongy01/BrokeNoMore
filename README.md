# BrokeNoMore!



### *Inspiration*  
We wanted to create a fun, intuitive, and AI-powered way to help people manage their expenses without the hassle of spreadsheets or confusing finance apps. The idea was born from our own struggles with budgeting and the need for a tool that not only tracks spending but also provides smart insights in a conversational way.  

### *What it does*  
*Broke No More* tracks your transactions, categorizes expenses, and provides a real-time visualization dashboard for better financial awareness. With an integrated AI assistant, it answers questions about your spending habits, suggests savings strategies, and helps you make informed financial decisions.  

### *How we built it*  
We developed the web app using *React* for the frontend and *Node.js with Express* for the backend. For AI capabilities, we integrated a *large language model (LLM)* to process financial queries. The database, powered by *MongoDB, efficiently stores transaction data, while **D3.js* and *Chart.js* bring the expense visualizations to life.  

### *Challenges we ran into*  
- Training the AI to provide *meaningful financial advice* without overcomplicating responses.  
- Ensuring *secure and efficient transaction tracking* while maintaining user privacy.  
- Optimizing data visualization for *clarity and usability*, making it engaging yet informative.  

### *Accomplishments that we're proud of*  
- Successfully integrating an *LLM for interactive financial insights*.  
- Designing an intuitive *dashboard that makes budgeting fun and visual*.  
- Building a *seamless user experience* that simplifies finance management for all.  

### *What we learned*  
- The importance of *user-friendly financial analytics* and how data visualization impacts decision-making.  
- How to fine-tune an *LLM for specific use cases* like expense tracking and financial planning.  
- Best practices in *securely handling financial data* while ensuring app scalability.  

### *What's next for Broke No More*  
- *AI-powered savings recommendations* based on spending patterns.  
- *Multi-user finance tracking* for households or small teams.  
- *Integration with banking APIs* to automate transaction logging.  
- A *mobile app version* for on-the-go expense management.
